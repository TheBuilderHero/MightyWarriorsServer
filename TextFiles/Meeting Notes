Meeting Notes 8/3/2022:	

- Discuss ideas for combat, move towards strategic actions/choices
	- main quest (needed to complete the game)
		- 
		- idea: main character has to go to every races main city to gather peices of a weapon used to isolate the avoidends origin. at the final boss fight the weapon fails and the main character is forced to fight void cat one on one.
			- Not satisfying if the weapon gets broken. (Dom is fine with the weapon becoming broken. As long as you have another option to defeat void cat with special bonus.)
			- What you are collecting is something to get to void cat instead of kill void cat.
			- Item you are collecting gives you the bonus for the final battle. This is like a super power up.
			- Two modes
				- Using the weapon
				- Not using the weapon
			- Alternative:
				- Scrap collacting pieces and change it to something else.
					- Reason to visit each city
						- Allies to help you fight the void cat (This is the picked idea)
						- inital reasoning for going to each city was needing to fight off all evil
						- Each nation gives a resistance combine to help you defeat the void cat.

	- branch quests (Not needed to complete the game. However, they contribute directly to the main story)
	- side quests (Completely seperate stories)

- Possible Psychic effect ideas
	- Chance option so that it is a chance to give them an effect (20 mental strength and 21 mental attack you have a 1 in 21 to cause an affect on them)
		- speed and damage goes up while mental and intelect goes down.
		- This would be good for mages because they will likely build 
	- If you have a successful role
		- you do another role for which effect you can apply
			- different effect levels
			- how far over their mental strength is not needed right now
			- psychic is mainly based on chance
			- strengths are 50/50 since the strengths are roughly the same.
			- 
- Races
	- ghosts
		- Are they a spirit or are they really something else?
			- What does it mean ghost race.
				- No idea.
				- They are physical because of the tech of the day
				- They are concious AI
				- Leave ghosts unexplained
			- Not ideal to make them completely immune to physical damage
				- This would then make it possible to be a single individual instead of a party.
			- The ghosts passive sometimes dodges attacks both physical and magic
				- Can only occur once per battle
				- You get the choice to activate going etherial
					- Needs to be charged up somehow

- Discuss ideas for combat, move towards strategic actions/choices
	- Combat needs to be more strategic
		- each move needs to have a profound impact on the outcome of the battle
		- Limited amount of power you can use for each attacks
			- Natural energy and stamina
				- each round gives you 5
				- blocking gives you 10
			- Does not like the fact that it forces you to wait
		- have different types of physical attacks
			- slash
			- stab
			- pummels
			- some enemies are more resistant to the certain types of attacks
			- Do we want to add more buttons?
				- add more buttons and have them set buttons before battle
				- you could leave Q W E R then those buttons open another menu (slower more thought out option)
					- sub menus for each:
						- Q physical attacks
							- sub menu
						- W magical attacks
							- sub menu
						- E blocking types
							- sub menu
						- R special moves
							- sub menu
					- Maybe these are based on your weapon or gear:
						- Q physical attacks
						- W magical attacks
						- E blocking types
						- R special moves
					- Equipment is attacked to Q W E R
						- Equip weapon in main hand Q
						- Equip secondary weapon in off hand W
						- Abilities are associated with the equipment you are wearing
						- Different abilities could be associated with different key bindings
						- different weapons could be associated with different abilities
						- the combinations could then be associated with different ultimate abilities
							- The ultimate could change or gain new ultimates as you level up
							- 3 choices in their life time throughout leveling
								- first just requires you to use a certain weapon
								- second weapon and armor
								- third certain item
						- Chose paths to determine ultimate designation
						- Class was chosen and gives you ultimate options based on that 
				- Richard will look into what we will do with weapons and abilities
						
				- make it two handed game by making hotkeys perform your different attacks instead of sub menu
					- maybe user can set them up
						- they have limited slots for battle optoins so not able to change during combat
							- this adds a pre-meditated aspect to the game.
						- or have it able to change within combat via key
- Brush over missing discussions
	- World lore
		- Deity
			- Each race has its own god.
				- beliefs stem from that
				- Does this god give you different strengths/buffs.
			- player starts out with no religion and can choose a religion
				- this will give you the buffs from the religion
				- They can swap religions to get different buffs thus it does not matter to choose early and then change later

		- Race relations
			- Opinion
				- good and bad
					- What are these
			- family relations
			- landmarks and cities
			- race location and boarders
			- Important is religion and world geography
			- input for all of the above is appriciated
				- send picture to the group and get input from where the races live
			- Religion is classed as practice and devosion 
				- Each year practiced gives you stronger abilities
				

		- Terrain effects the strength of their abilities or attacks and resistances
			- some of this matches up but maybe not all of them
		- Story line is not completely explained at the begiuining
			- you gain more as you go
			- you are given some at the beguining like a overall goal
		
		- Mops are not gender less (no none binary mops)
		- Is normal potato going to be an easter egg?
			- Yes, however not hard to face. This is unlike the mop
				- Hint at how to get the mop throughout the game
				- You should come across a normal potato on mabye even a normal quest in a normal place to come across a normal potato
				- Normal potato is not associated with anything or anyone
					- it is a legendary creature
					- shows up a void cat fight and kills voidcat when on last hit
				- (just testing) Normal potato quest is east from the starting area
		- Run all changes to the story by dominic so that he knows
			- Make document for completed tasks (already have it) but make it seperate
			- Two documents for completed items
				- gameplay/story related changes
				- other code related changes
			- Theory testing of the game
				- Richard will take charge of the more theoretical aspects of the game
- "I will enjoy my cheese with a normal potato" - Richard




Meeting Notes of 4/23/2022
•	Enemies:
o	  Who are the Enemies?
	    They destroyed a city.
•	Your character is picked because of your skill set and then sends you to help other races to come together as a team to fight the enemies.
o	  This gives the character the ability to travel
•	The lore is that you are a mop
•	The world story comes from the time of 3001 
o	  The enemies
	    “Avoidends” is the name of the enemy
o	  Normal cities and taken cities
o	  Dystopian world but plenty of cities are safe.
o	  Maybe days and year differences like this planet has longer days then years.
The game components:
	    Plans for Game
o	  Make the game opening more sleek
	    Instead of asking for if you have an account. Have it a logon page
o	  Should have all the basics of the game put in place
	    The game should have a cohesive story that plays a role in that game to the point of usefulness.
	    We need to make a system for quests – battles to go along with those
	    Give missions to users.
o	  Battle should take how many hits should enemy hits be before you are taken down.
	    Basic should die in 2 – 3 hits from a normal character
	    Mild is 10-20 hits 
	    In the fighting of the monster, you will get a message
	    The monsters scale with level and have levels of difficulty
	    There is a primid difficulty system for monsters
o	  Quest handling system
	    With groups
	    The groups will not have all of one thing
	    These will have a boss in most groups
	    Need descriptions and 
	    Flexible coding for location type battles
	    So, upon selecting location the mission with possible missions, then you can select the quest from the list.
o	  The penalty of death
	    Maybe gold to be brought back to life
	    Death and save system and maybe later do something wake up at doctor (costs money)
	    Maybe loose item
o	  Shop system
	    Later in the game we will discuss this
o	  Battling 
	    Using an ability uses stamina or mana
	    Blocking slightly decreases stamina or mana but you take less damage
	    You can also wait which does not take any mana or stamina but does not expend mana or stamina
	    Each round you gain stamina or mana
	    Too many manus to get to what you want to do.
o	  Straighter to the point.
	    Summary:
o	  Quest system
o	  Location system
o	  Group system
o	  Bosses
o	  Death system
o	  World Story Line
