Dakota - Standard battle function with consideration of questing. (Load the xp reward when the moster is selected before hand)
         Add location data to players' saved info on server
         Add quest data to players' saved info on server
         Add different display resolution options for the terminal alignment:
                  1280 x 1024 Super-eXtended Graphics Array (SXGA)
                  1366 x 768 High Definition (HD)
                  1600 x 900 High Definition Plus (HD+)
                  1920 x 1080 Full High Definition (FHD)
         (Paused) Adding passives to the game 
         (Paused) Add a standard battle function that can be used for most if not all battle events. 
         (In Progress) Set up the saving of both the location data and quest data.
         (In Progress) Add a class for data protection, so that when the console is closed the player's data will be saved.
                  - Need to be able to save all data back to file on server. However, since the server does not send stats to the client all seperately we need to record 
                  the changes in these stats so that we can send the new value back to the server and make sure it is recorded acurately. 
         (In Progress) Impliment a server case save user data to the server making use of the subCipher functions. This needs to only send back the additional stats which are added to the player's Character. We need to start recarding that information in TempEntity.
                  - Same save issue as mentinons above with Data Protection

          Add monster group functionality
          Add travel battles/events
          
                  **I have this idea that Psychic damage always starts at 0, and you just buff your Max Psychic Damage Stat
                  **Not implementing this yet because I'd like to hear other people's thoughts first
