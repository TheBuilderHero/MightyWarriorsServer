****UPDATES FROM RICHARD****
Here's a list of stuff that I have done over the last couple days:
-created basic Quest class and added one sample Quest
-created a world map class with six locations and travel function
-created Quest specific enemies
-created Quest specific battle function
-created travel menu
-connected Quest to battle function and to server to pull specific enemies
-connected world map to main game menu through travel menu 
That's all I can remember right now

We(Dakota) still need to:
-add location data to players' saved info
-add quest data to players' saved info
-add questing functionality, possibly through separate quest menu
-connect location data to travel menu
-connect location and quest saves to questing functionality
-TEST EVERYTHING (I have tested nothing so far)
Thanx m9s. Void Cat Weak Peace Oot!
