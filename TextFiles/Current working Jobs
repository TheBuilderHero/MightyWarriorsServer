Dakota - (Paused) Adding passives to the game 
         (Paused) Add a standard battle function that can be used for most if not all battle events. 
         (In Progress) Changes in stats need to be tracked on the client side so that we  can accurately track the new stats of a character. 
                  - We need to start recording that information in TempEntity.
                  - Probably need to loop this into the Data Protection function.
         (In Progress) Finish properly constructing map functionality and city/object interactions
         Add intro to the game so that the player is given some basic info about it.
         Add adaptable dialogue function for interactions with objects and characters.

         Resolve issue with non-base stats not being added to players total stats.
         Group battle screen will put you into a single-unit battle screen when you try using your ultimate ability and are out of uses.
                  Also, seems to make the destructor for the DataGuard run twice.
         Add options menu-         
                  Adding game zoom settings - in the menu
         Add advance quests for temp entity so that we can make the NPC missions have a reference to save back to the server.
         Use Quest class to better setup NPC quests.
         There is an issue that sets your current City location back to (1,1) if you try to travel to (3,7)
         Update save and load to use X Y coordinates instead of location value.
         Resolve issue with guard.updateGuardData(); crashing the game
